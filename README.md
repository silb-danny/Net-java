neural network library for java


for this neural network library there are two variations.
1. the first is a node based approach that uses single node arrays to describe the neural network. this is kind of a dumb and slow approach
2. the second approach is a matrix based one wich uses matrices to describe layers in the network. this the faster and more economical approach, also this is how usualy neural networks (at least simple ones) are calculated
